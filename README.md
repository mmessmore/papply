# papply

papply is an exercise for me to try and clone the featureset of
[ksb's][ksb] excellent [xapply][msrc] tool, that I can't live without
in Python

It is a combination/reimagination of the possibilities of combining the
goodness of [apply][] with [xargs][].  Technically with modern
xargs you can do most of this, but it's cumbersome to spell it all out
for the thing.

I will admit on the front-end it is a failure.  This is just an excuse
for me to

1. play with processes
2. have something that's "good enough" in places I can't bring [msrc][] 
with me
