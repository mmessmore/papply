# papply

papply is an exercise for me to try and clone the featureset of ksb's
excellent xapply tool, that I can't live without in Python

It is a combination/reimagination of the possibilities of combining the
goodness of apply with xargs.  Technically with modern xargs you can do
most of this, but it's cumbersome to spell it all out for the thing.

I will admit on the front-end it is a failure.  This is just an excuse
for me to

1. play with processes
2. have something that's "good enough" in places I can't bring
install_base and msrc_base
